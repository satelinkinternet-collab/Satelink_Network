## SLOT DETAIL

### Slot 1 — BACKEND_WORKER — auth_login_fix
- **Result:** `createUnifiedAuthRouter` mounted at `/auth` in `apps/api/src/app_factory.mjs`
- **Commit:** 14d1704
- **Impact:** Authentication endpoints (`/auth/login`, etc.) returned 404 before this fix; now live.

### Slot 2 — FRONTEND_WORKER — admin_panel_live_data
- **Result:** Admin panel wired to real API data (assumed complete — no explicit DONE entry in PROGRESS.md)
- **Risk:** No commit hash recorded. Next cycle includes a FRONTEND_WORKER verification pass.
- **Targets were:** `/api/status` (epoch), `/admin/nodes` (node count), `/admin/revenue`, `/system/free-tier`

### Slot 3 — CONVERSION_MONITOR — conversion_check
- **Result:** Report written to `agent/memory/CONVERSIONS.md`
- **Data:** 2820 total IPs tracked · 70 near-limit (90%+) · 0 at-limit · 416,822 calls today
- **Action needed:** NO — healthy conversion pool, no throttling pressure

### Slot 4 — SENTINEL — health_check
- **Result:** Report written to `agent/memory/SENTINEL_STATUS.md`
- **Data:** `/health` OK (db: ok, uptime: 183757s) · `/api/status` operational · epoch 4757
- **Node count:** 0 nodes online (registration not yet active)
- **Overall:** HEALTHY

### Slot 5 — GROWTH_WORKER — operator_guide
- **Result:** `docs/NODE_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md` written
- **Contents:** node registration, heartbeat, earnings, claims, support
- **Impact:** Operator onboarding documentation ready for outreach

## PRODUCTION STATE AT END OF CYCLE 1

| Metric              | Value                                    |

| Near-Limit IPs      | 70 (90%+ utilization)                    |
| Daily API Calls     | 416,822                                  |
| Revenue             | Mainnet USDT settlement PENDING          |
| Operator Guide      | Written, not yet distributed             |

## RISK FLAGS

1. **Slot 2 unverified** — FRONTEND_WORKER marked done by assumption. Admin panel live-data wiring may be incomplete.
2. **0 nodes online** — No node operators yet; dependent on operator outreach and registration system activation.
3. **USDT settlement pending** — Revenue loop not closed. Cycle 2 Slot 1 is REVENUE_WORKER.
4. **No autoscaling** — Railway autoscaling not yet configured; high-load events could cause degradation.

---

## CYCLE 2 QUEUE (see MASTER_TASK_QUEUE.md)

Slots 1–6 defined. Revenue-first ordering. REVENUE_WORKER leads.

---

## NOTES

- Budget discipline maintained: Gemini Flash Lite used for monitoring/ops agents (Slots 3, 4).
- All agents operated within Max Turn limits.
- Next CEO activation: when REVENUE_WORKER writes DONE for Cycle 2 Slot 1.

## CYCLE 2 INCIDENTS — ORCHESTRATOR LOG

### 2026-05-29T08:30:00Z — SAT-55: Port 8080 Conflict (BACKEND_WORKER)
- **Trigger:** SENTINEL reported (SAT-41) that Satelink API is DOWN/Unreachable at localhost:8080
- **Root cause:** Paperclip API runs on http://127.0.0.1:8080 — same port as Satelink Express backend
- **Issue created:** SAT-55 assigned to BACKEND_WORKER (high priority)
- **Link to C2-EMERGENCY:** SAT-55 and C2-EMERGENCY (Railway healthcheck crash) are likely the same root cause — port binding failure.
- **Resolution path:** BACKEND_WORKER investigates via `lsof -i :8080`, changes local dev port if needed, verifies `/health` returns 200
- **Status:** Delegated — awaiting BACKEND_WORKER resolution

## SAT-56 CYCLE — 2026-05-29 (afternoon)
**Status:** COMPLETE (5/5 slots + ORCHESTRATOR)

| Slot | Agent | Task | Result | Commit |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| SAT56-1 | BACKEND_WORKER | Backend stability (SAT-23) | express.json 10mb limit; filter error → DEBUG; port conflict verified clear | 582f544 |
| SAT56-2 | CONVERSION_MONITOR | Free-tier check | 82 active IPs; 2519 calls; 0 at-limit; CONVERSIONS.md updated | — |
| SAT56-3 | SENTINEL | Health check | /health=ok, db=ok, epoch=5732, SENTINEL_STATUS.md updated | — |
| SAT56-4 | FRONTEND_WORKER | Admin panel + 402 prompt (SAT-13) | Admin already live; 402→JSON-RPC error -32005 added to gateway | 119bfac |
| SAT56-5 | GROWTH_WORKER | Paid tier quickstart | docs/PAID_TIER_QUICKSTART.md: USDT deposit flow, pricing, Vultr guide | ca2e606 |
| SAT56-6 | ORCHESTRATOR | Cycle review + Cycle 3 queue | This entry |

**Production state at cycle end:**
- API: HEALTHY (Railway, /health=ok, db=ok)
- Epoch: 5732 (incrementing correctly)
- Active IPs: 82 (free tier, no paid users)
- Nodes online: 0 (no operators yet)
- Revenue: $0.00 USDT
- Free tier: 500 calls/day, 402 upgrade prompt functional

**Remaining blockers:**
- SAT-8: Chainlist PR — HUMAN MUST SUBMIT to github.com/ethereum-lists/chains (file ready at docs/chainlist_mainnet_pr.md)
- 0 active node operators → no revenue
- No paid RPC calls observed

**Next priority:** Node operator acquisition. Without operators online, the settlement system has no earnings to distribute. The highest-leverage action after SAT-8 is getting the first node operator running.
